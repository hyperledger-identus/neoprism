# Single Node Deployment: NeoPRISM Indexer

A single node deployment of the NeoPRISM indexer involves running the indexer service on one machine. The indexer connects to a Cardano node to read and validate DID operations from the blockchain, and stores the indexed data in a local PostgreSQL database. This setup is suitable for development, testing, or small-scale production environments where high availability and load balancing are not required.
